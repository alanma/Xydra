=== Commands ===

Commands are atomic change requests.
A command can {add,remove} a {(1) field, (2) object, (3) model} to a 
{(1) object, (2) model, (3) repository} OR it can {change} the value of a field.

Executing a command results in a new revision number or 'NO_CHANGE' or 'FAILED'.

Commands can be executed in 3 modes:

FORCED 
* 

SAFE revision-bound

SAFE pre-condition bound

A transaction is a list of commands, that are executed in an atomic fashion.
A transaction must contain at least 1 command.

transaction that just adds and removes a field.

A transaction is scoped, it is either a model transaction, an object transaction,
